The Challenge
Motus dealerships receive thousands of leads monthly, yet only a small fraction convert to actual sales.
This creates a critical resource allocation problem: sales teams spend valuable time pursuing low-potential leads while high-intent buyers may be overlooked.

Solution
A predictive model that estimates each lead's probability of converting to a vehicle sale.
By accurately identifying high-conversion prospects, the model will enable dealers to optimize sales efforts and marketing resources toward leads with the highest commercial potential.
